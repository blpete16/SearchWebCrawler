Name: Edward TwidwellTitle: ProfessorSpecialization: Pasture, Forage Crops & Small GrainsE-mail: Department: School of Plant, Environmental and Soil SciencesOrganization: LSU AgCenterAddress 1: 220 M.B. SturgisAddress 2: Baton Rouge, LA 70803Phone Number: (225) 578-4564Fax Number: 





Education/TrainingB.S., Kansas State UniversityM.S., Purdue UniversityPh.D., Purdue University

Areas of Specialization/ResearchMy primary area deals with the production and management of forage crops. The major forage crops grown in Louisiana include bermudagrass, bahiagrass, annual ryegrass, and various clovers. More than 2 million acres of land in Louisiana produce grazing and stored forages for animal consumption. I also work closely with the Forage Testing Laboratory. 
I perform applied research projects dealing with pasture weed control. This involves the comparison of different herbicide products for control of broadleaf and grassy weeds in pastures, hayfields and fencerows.
I am also responsible for several 4-H activities, including being the superintendent of the Plant Science Contest during 4-H University.

Professional ExperienceI worked as an Extension Specialist in the area of forage crops in South Dakota from 1987 to 1994 before moving to the LSU AgCenter in 1995. I work closely with extension agents throughout the state in providing educational programs dealing with forage crops. This involves demonstration field plots, meetings, field days, producer visits, written publications, phone calls and emails.
