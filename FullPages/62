  I am an associate professor at
    Division of Electrical & Computer Engineering,
    School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS), LSU.
    I finished my undergraduate study in 2003 at  University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)
    with a major in Computer Science,
    and obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in  Computer Science
    from  State University of New York at Stony Brook in 2005 and 2008.
    I joined the faculty of LSU in 2008.
    I hold a joint position in the Center for Computation & Technology (CCT), LSU.
    I am an adjunct associate professor at Division of Computer Science, EECS, LSU since 2009.
    I am also an adjunct associate professor at  Pennington Biomedical Research Center.
