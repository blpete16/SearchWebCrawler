Research Interest

    The aim of my research is to enhance the productivity of programmers
    by giving them better tools.

    Topics:
    design and implementation of
    domain-specific languages,
    compiler optimization,
    desktop grids,
    object-oriented languages,
    software engineering tools,
    and embedded systems programming tools.
