Cotton biotechnology and tissue culture
Cotton is the most important natural textile fiber in the world, as well as a major source of oil and protein. Within the LSU Agricultural Center, the Cotton Breeding and Genetics Program seeks to develop improved germplasm and variety that addresses the needs of Louisiana cotton producers in particular and the broader market as well. Major focal points are yield and fiber quality. Fiber yield, per se, is the largest factor affecting profitable production. Improvement may be enhanced by focusing on yield components, their aggregate, as well as stability across environments. As spinning technologies improve, the many components of fiber quality have become increasingly important. New analytical methods to assess fiber quality and end-product prediction tools are being researched.
The environments in which cotton is grown can present both biotic and abiotic stresses. Our current efforts focus on several host plant resistance traits shown effective against plant bugs and nematodes. For nematodes in particular, both traditional and marker based breeding methods are being employed. The focus of our current abiotic stress research is on the identification of germplasm with tolerance to elevated salt concentrations and underlying genes involved. 
The Cotton Breeding and Genetics Program also coordinates the Official Cotton Variety Trials for the State of Louisiana.
