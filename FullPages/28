Name: Jim Jian WangTitle: ProfessorSpecialization: Environmental Soil Chemistry & TestingE-mail: Department: School of Plant, Environmental and Soil SciencesOrganization: LSU AgCenterAddress 1: 313 M. B. SturgisAddress 2: Baton Rouge, LA 70803Phone Number: (225) 578-1360Fax Number: 





Education/TrainingB.S. in Soils and Agrochemistry, Northwestern University of Agriculture, Yaling, China, 1982M.S. in Soil Chemistry, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, 1986Ph.D. in Soil Chemistry, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, 1990

Areas of Specialization/ResearchMy research focuses on chemical interactions between different nutrients/pollutants and soil constituents with emphasis on ternary systems of clay minerals, heavy metals, and common natural ligands for controlling metal mobility in soil. Recent research efforts have also focused on adsorption/desorption and degradation processes of organic chemicals of emerging concern (such as veterinary antibiotics and hormones) in soil-water systems and manure matrices. In addition, I am interested in the biogeochemical control of carbon and nitrogen processes in agricultural and natural ecosystems with emphasis on linking the belowground carbon transformation to the aboveground emissions of carbon and non-carbon greenhouse gases. Other research areas include: biochar properties and functions, metal adsorption by nanoparticles, beneficial use of wastes, and methodology development of nutrient soil testing and plant analysis.

Professional Experience
