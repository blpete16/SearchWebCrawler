About me

I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Louisiana State University. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University in 2010 and 2009. I received my M.E. and B.E. degrees at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University in 2003 and 2000. Before joining Louisiana State University, I was a research scientist with Circuits and Systems Research, Intel Labs. I am a recipient of NSF CAREER Award in 2015.
Note: I am looking for Ph.D. students with a strong interest in systems research. If you are interested in working with me, please send me email with your recent CV and transcripts.
