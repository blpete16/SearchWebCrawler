Name: Maud WalshTitle: Professor; Undergraduate and Graduate AdvisorSpecialization: Environmental Education and GeomicrobiologyE-mail: Department: School of Plant, Environmental and Soil SciencesOrganization: LSU AgCenterAddress 1: 110 Sturgis HallAddress 2: Baton Rouge, LA 70803Phone Number: (225) 578-1211Fax Number: 





Education/TrainingB.A. English Literature, Bryn Mawr College 1975
M.L.S. Library Science, Louisiana State University 1976
Ph.D. Geology, Louisiana State University 1989

Areas of Specialization/ResearchMy academic appointment in the School of Plant, Environmental, and Soil Sciences is 60% teaching and advising, 20% service and 20% research.
I teach  EMS 1011-Environment and Technology: Perspective on Environmental Problems, which  covers basic scientific principles, environmental problems and solutions, ecology, societal issues, policy; AMS/AGRO/HORT 2011-Analysis of Environmental Issues, an introduction to reading, writing and speaking in the sciences, EMS 3040-Applied Environmental Management, which focuses on applying, integrating, and communicating scientific, legal, and social information in managing environmental resources, and EMS 3050 Environmental Regulations and Compliance .  The first three classes are certified as communication-intensive courses by the LSU Communication across the Curriculum program and incorporate service-learning with community partners that include the East Baton Rouge Recycling Office and LSU Sustainability. I also oversee student internships (AGRO 3090 and EMS 3090) and direct independent projects (AGRO 4092 and EMS 3999).
I am the Undergraduate Advisor for Environmental Management Systems majors and Plant & Soil Systems majors in the Crop Science, Soil Science, and Sustainable Production Systems concentrations and am the Graduate Advisor for the M.S. and Ph.D. programs in the School of Plant, Environmental, and Soil Sciences. Since 2010 I am a coordinator of the sustainability track of the Agricultural Residential College.  I am also a faculty member in Women’s and Gender Studies. I serve on the University Review and Assessment Committee, the Service-Learning Advisory Council, and the Sustainability Curriculum in Education Committee.
My research interests include environmental education and communication, environmental remediation and the geologic record of early life and environments on Earth. For the past 17 years I have helped lead science education professional development institutes for elementary and middle-school teachers. I am the Research Translation Core Leader for a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program focused on health effects of environmentally persistent free radicals.  My responsibilities include communicating the research findings of the LSU Superfund Research Program (www.srp.lsu.edu) to environmental professionals, government agencies, health professionals, and the general public.  Recent environmental remediation projects with graduate students focused on phytoremediation of arsenic-contaminated soil and on strategies for planting restored coastal areas in Louisiana. My geologic studies focus on some of the oldest rocks on Earth to learn more about conditions under which life existed on the young Earth, and to develop strategies for searching for evidence of life on other planets, particularly Mars.
