About me

I am an Assistant Professor at Division of Computer Science and Engineering in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Louisiana State University (LSU). I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012, under the guidance of Guy Lebanon. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from University of Kentucky in 2006 and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University, China in 2004. I was a Senior Scientist with playlist recommendation group, Pandora Media Inc from 2012 to 2015. 

Research Interests
My research area is statistical machine learning, information retrieval and visualization. I am particularly interested in developing scalable algorithms to make use of massive data for prediction and recommendation tasks. 
 To prospective students:: I am looking for motivated graduate students and visiting scholars. If you are interested, please e-mail me at msun 'AT' csc 'DOT' lsu 'DOT' edu with your CV and transcripts.
