Areas of Specialization/ResearchPrincipal and Co-Investigator for several competitive grants (USDA Capacity Building, USDA SARE R&E, USDA SARE Organic, USDA SARE Graduate Student research and USDA 1433 Formula Funds) dealing with the epidemiology, control, and genetics of ruminant nematode parasitism. Research program focuses on improving ruminant production using an integrated approach to controlling parasites. Area of special expertise is small ruminant gastrointestinal nematode parasitism. Current research effort is two-fold: 1) To determine why, and/or how, Gulf Coast Native sheep are relatively more resistant to gastrointestinal nematode infection than Suffolk sheep, and 2) To evaluate alternative (non-chemical) approaches for protection against nematode infection. In 1), lab is evaluating segregation of resistance leading to identification of closely linked genetic markers associated with resistance using an F2 reference family approach. Such genetic markers can then be used for selection purposes and for fine mapping quantitative trait loci. Differences in the host immune response (Th1 vs. Th2) that might account for resistance are also being characterized. In 2), Nematode-trapping fungi, condensed tannin-containing plants, copper wire particles, and vaccination protocols in conjunction with strategic use of anthelmintics are being evaluated for use in integrated control programs. Co-founder of the Southern Consortium for Small Ruminant Parasite Control which conducts research and extends results to producers throughout the SE US and where appropriate, the rest of the US and internationally.
