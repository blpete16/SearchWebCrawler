      Overview
I am an associate professor of Computer Science Department at Louisiana State University. 

I received my Ph.D. from the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, 2004.


      Before that, I also received a B.S. degree from  Computer Science at  Korea University, Seoul, Korea and a M.S. degree in   Computer Science from KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), Teajon, Korea in 1993 and 1995, respectively.

      From 1995 to 2000, I worked for Shinsegi Telecomm, which is the first CDMA cellular service provider in the world and now merged into the  SK Telecom.

      
CV (Curriculum Vitae)








   
      Research
In general, I am interested in issues involving Networking and Data
Intensive Computing. More specifically: 
      
High Speed Networks for High Performance Computing

 Design of new transport layer protocols and topology
control schemes for High Performance Computing Applications over high
speed networks, such as National Lamda Rail and LONI (Louisiana
Optical Network Initiative)
            

 Cyberinfrastructure for Data Intensive Computing

 Developing frameworks for large-scale scientific
applications (such as Computational Biology, Chemistry) using data intensive computing frameworks (such as Hadoop and Pregel) over cloud computing and high performance computing infrastructures 

Wireless Sensor Networks 

 Energy efficient reliable transport protocol 
 data dissemination using graph theory and optimal control

Wireless Ad-hoc Networks 

 Improvement of transport protocol over ad hoc networks 
 Adaptive topology control 
 Medium Access Control protocol
