Education/TrainingPh. D. (Botany-Plant Biotechnology), 2000, Utkal University, India, Research conducted at the International Rice Research institute (IRRI), Philippines, and Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), India

Areas of Specialization/ResearchPlant (a)biotic stress Molecular biologyFunctional genomicsGenetic engineeringTissue culture and dihaploid breeding
Research in my group uses a holistic approach, integrating molecular biology and functional genomics tools, with an overarching goal of improving agronomic traits of interest in sugarcane and other commodities. Inexorable climate change scenarios would only exacerbate the edapho-environmental stressors that negatively impact the growth and productivity of field crops. Strategies to develop climate-resilient designer crops depend on our depth of knowledge of plant’s responses to these stressors at molecular, physiological and biochemical levels. Our research program involves basic molecular biology investigations in model plants to understand and identify the interplay of molecular genetic networks that regulate plant's tolerance/adaptability to extreme environments. The knowledge generated from the basic research program are being translated to develop genetic tools to improve field crops, such as sugarcane, wheat, rice, cotton and sweetpotato. 

DNA-based marker assisted breeding (MAB) can help speed up conventional efforts to develop improved sugarcane varieties for the Louisiana sugar industry. Identification of stable molecular markers linked to a particular trait of interest, for example sucrose content, and biotic and abiotic stress resistance, is the key to a successful MAB. We have deployed molecular markers to understand genetic structure of the Louisiana sugarcane gene pool – this information is currently being used in selection of parents for the crossing program to make sure maximum diversity is maintained to increase genetic gain. Our research focus is (1) to identify markers associated with high sucrose content using genomic selection – this will increase the accuracy of predicting phenotypes or genomic values of new breeding lines; and (2) to identify and implement markers for resistance to brown rust, leaf scald, and other imminent stressors through a combination of gene expression and genome/association mapping strategies. 

Sugarcane, in addition to its importance as a sugar crop, is regarded as an important second generation bioenergy grass (popularly known as energycane). However, for energycane to be a viable biofuel crop it should have the ability to produce high cellulosic biomass in marginal lands that are not suitable for commercial sugarcane cultivation. In Louisiana, the cultivation of sugarcane as dedicated biomass crop will have to be pushed northward, and energycanes will have to be cold tolerant. Our research aims to identify specific genes and gene-networks and decipher the genic regions that govern cold tolerance traits towards development of allele-specific functional markers. For this, early generation hybrids from the basic breeding program (collaborative effort of the USDA-ARS, Houma) will be used for QTL mapping and association genetics with cold-responsive gene-derived markers. Similar experimental approaches are being used for development of molecular markers to complement wheat breeding program aimed at developing improved wheat cultivars with desirable agronomic traits of interest, such as herbicide tolerance, stripe rust resistance, Fusarium head blight etc.
