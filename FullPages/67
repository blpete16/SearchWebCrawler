Welcome to my webpage. I received the Bachelor and Master degrees in Computer Science & Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, China. After that, I obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Florida in Spring 2005. I joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Louisiana State University in August 2005. My research focus on computer architecture, memory hierarchy system, reliability, power efficiency, and big data analytics. I received an ORAU Ralph E. Powe Junior Faculty Enhancement Award in 2007 and a Best Paper Award from IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (processor architecture track) in 2001.
