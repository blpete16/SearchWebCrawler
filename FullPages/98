About Me








						I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Louisiana State University. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2014.
						

To prospective students:
							I'm always looking for students who share my research interests and have a solid background in computer systems. If you are interested, please e-mail me with your CV and transcripts. 
						






Teaching





 CS4610 Virtualization and Cloud Systems (Fall 2015)

 CS4740 Big Data Technologies (Spring 2015)

 CS2610 Cloud Fundamentals and Web Programming (Spring 2015, Fall 2014)






Research








							My research is in distributed systems and cloud computing with a current focus on  performance and scalability analysis of large-scale web applications (e.g., Amazon)
							

							My research is motivated by the essential requirement of simultaneously achieving good performance and high utilization for cost efficiency in cloud computing environments.  Good performance (e.g., fast response time) is critical for the business of e-commerce web applications like Amazon. High utilization through virtualization and hardware resource sharing is essential for cloud venders for high return on investment. However, both practitioners and researchers have experienced large response time fluctuations or unpredictable performance in cloud, especially when the utilization becomes high. To solve this problem, my research has been focusing on two aspects: first, investigate various system-level factors that cause the performance unpredictability of web applications running at high resource utilization; second, design, implement, and evaluate practical solutions to mitigate the negative impact of those factors and achieve the performance predictability at high resource utilization.
