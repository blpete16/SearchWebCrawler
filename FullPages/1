Development of new sweet potato cultivars

Sweet potato molecular genetics
As a sweetpotato breeder and geneticist, I focus on developing new cultivars for the sweetpotato industry. This is a collaborative effort with several scientists at the LSU AgCenter. Although industry requirements change, high yield and disease resistance are always critical traits. The industry today is faced with two major challenges: increasing production costs and crop loss due to flooding. On the positive side, the industry is also enjoying increased consumer demand through new value-added products like French fried sweetpotatoes. 
There are several ways we try to counteract higher production costs. Increased yield without increased cost is a classic goal that is difficult to achieve, given the high yield of today’s varieties, but we keep trying! Other, more subtle, options include improved shape and higher grade out. Although the demand for fresh, whole sweetpotatoes continues to increase, many sweetpotatoes are unsuitable because of minor shape imperfections. Increasing the percent of sweetpotatoes which can be sold unprocessed is very important. The breeding program is also developing varieties with a tougher skin to enable mechanical harvest, thus saving labor costs. These varieties will be for processing and may not be acceptable on the fresh market, but given the growth in the processing sector, it is a clear priority. 
The genetics program is closely allied with the breeding program. Our current emphasis is to identify and characterize genes which are involved in storage root development and environmental factors critical in storage root initiation. There is also a keen interest in understanding skinning resistance to aid in developing a more durable skin.

Professional ExperienceAdministration:I currently serve as the director of the School of Plant, Environmental and Soil Sciences. Research Contribution: Plant breeding is by nature a cooperative endeavor. The sweetpotato scientific and extension group at the LSU AgCenter is closely involved in the evaluation and development of new cultivars. Our most recent release is LA 07-146, which set a new yield benchmark and makes excellent fries. Another release is Orleans, a cultivar that looks very similar to the popular Beauregard cultivar, but with slightly higher yield due to improved shape. Our breeding program also recently released the popular Bonita cultivar, which has a pink-tan skin and white flesh. Specialty types represent a small but growing segment of the industry. Teaching Experience: I team teach two classes - HORT 2860 – Growth and Development of Agricultural Crops, and HORT 7071 – Advanced Plant Genetics. I also coordinate the horticulture internship class, HORT 3000.
