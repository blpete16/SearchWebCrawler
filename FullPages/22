Name: Magdi SelimTitle: ProfessorSpecialization: Soil Physics, Watershed Hydrology, Water QualityE-mail: Department: School of Plant, Environmental and Soil SciencesOrganization: LSU AgCenterAddress 1: 305 M. B. SturgisAddress 2: Baton Rouge, LA 70803Phone Number: (225) 578-1332Fax Number: 





Education/TrainingPh.D., Soil Physics, Iowa State University; 1971 M.S., Soil Physics, Iowa State University; 1969 B.S., Soil Science, Alexandria University; 1964

Areas of Specialization/ResearchResearch accomplishments have been in the areas of solute and water flow in unsaturated and saturated soils, water management of irrigation and drainage systems, spatial and temporal variability of soil physical properties, and chemical an physical processes governing the interactions and transport of solutes in the root zone. My recent research emphasizes the role of slow heavy metals release and processes governing mechanism of heavy metals in the vadose zone. I am the original developer of the two-site (kinetic-equilibrium) model for retention of dissolved chemicals in soils and natural materials and subsequent multi-step/multi-reaction kinetic models which have been successfully used for the description of heavy metals, radio-nuclides, explosive contaminants, phosphorus, and pesticides in soils and subsurface media. Other research interests include; best management practices BMPs) of applied chemicals to soil: runoff and subsurface water losses; and total maximum daily load (TMDL): implementation and monitoring of management approaches to identify sources of pollutants at the watershed scale. 

Professional ExperienceAcademic Experience
Louisiana State University, Professor, Baton Rouge, Louisiana,1984-present Louisiana State University, Associate Professor, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 1980-1984 Louisiana State University, Assistant Professor, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 1977-1980
Teaching
AGRO 4077 (EMS 4077) - Environmental Soil Physics (3 Credits). AGRO 7057 (EMS 7057) - Advanced Soil Physics (4 Credits)Since my appointment at LSU in 1977, I have taught a variety of courses (listed below) but my main responsibility has been with AGRONOMY 7057. When given the responsibility to teach AGRON 7057 I completely redesigned the course to focus my teaching on fundamentals of soil physical processes. The fundamentals were then integrated with field applications from various disciplines. One can measure the success of this course based on the broad disciplines from which the students are drawn (e.g., Civil, Chemical, and Agricultural engineering, Botany, Forestry, Environmental studies). Moreover, I volunteered to teach a special topics course for engineering students (AGRON 8092) and more recently undergraduate Soil Science (AGRON 2051). Developed a new course Agro 4077 (Environmental Soil Physics) since there was no similar undergraduate course is currently offered by the Agronomy Department or other departments on campus. The course was approved in December and was offered for the first time in the Spring 2004.
