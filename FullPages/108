"Knowledge is experience. Everything else is just information."-  Einstein

"An ounce of experience is better than a ton of theory."

"By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is the noblest; Second, by imitation, which is the easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest."- Confucius




I am an associate professor in the School of Library and Information Science at the Louisiana State University (LSU).  I received my Ph.D. in Information Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP).


While at UMCP, I did most of my research at the Laboratory for Computational Linguistics and Information Processing, Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. 


My primary research areas are knowledge organization systems (such as taxonomy, thesaurus, topic maps, and ontology), 
information retrieval systems (especially cross-language information retrieval and text classification), and
computational linguistics for text analysis.  I am also interested in open-source information analysis education, including critical thinking & policy analysis. 


My teaching aims to educate technologically savvy knowledge workers.  
I believe graduate education should be challenging and rewarding. 
All of my courses have a component of creating an information/knowledge organization artifact, such as a database, Website,
digital library, information retrieval system, classification/taxonomy, and thesaurus.
