Research Interests
My research interests include:

High performance computing
Empirical optimization
Backend compiler optimization
Parallel computing
Scientific computing
Computer architecture

Here's a  list of my
papers and publications, and here's my
grants page.

Projects/software I've worked on

I'm the lead architect and developer of 
ATLAS,
a project that uses empirical timings to automatically tune the
BLAS and parts of 
LAPACK to arbitrary machines.
I'm the developer and maintainer of
Extract,
a software management tool.
I was one of the core developers of
ScaLAPACK,
a library providing a subset of LAPACK routines redesigned for distributed
memory MIMD parallel machines.
I am the sole developer of the BLACS,
the communication layer used by ScaLAPACK.
I've thrown a routine or two at 
LAPACK, and chaired the "C interface
to the legacy BLAS" session of the 
BLAST Forum.
